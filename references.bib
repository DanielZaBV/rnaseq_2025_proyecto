abstract={A number of researchers have speculated that neurological disorders are mostly due to the interaction of common susceptibility genes with environmental, epigenetic and stochastic factors. Genetic factors such as mutations, insertions, deletions and copy number variations (CNVs) are responsible for only a small subset of cases, suggesting unknown environmental contaminants play a role in triggering neurological disorders like idiopathic autism. Psychoactive pharmaceuticals have been considered as potential environmental contaminants as they are detected in the drinking water at very low concentrations. Preliminary studies in our laboratory identified gene sets associated with neuronal systems and human neurological disorders that were significantly enriched after treating fish brains with psychoactive pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations. These gene expression inductions were associated with changes in fish behavior. Here, we tested the hypothesis that similar treatments would alter in vitro gene expression associated with neurological disorders (including autism) in human neuronal cells. We differentiated and treated human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells with a mixture (fluoxetine, carbamazepine and venlafaxine) and valproate (used as a positive control to induce autism-associated profiles), followed by transcriptome analysis with RNA-Seq approach.},
